# This is a Bitcoin landing page project.

This was my very 1st disinterestedðŸ¤£ project i started while i was still starting to learn HTML AND CSS. I know you will keep wondering why i called it a 
disinterested project. It is actually because i was very new to this path of life and i had a lot of challenges i encountered while starting this project which 
includes giving up on the project coupled with i was so tired to continue. Most of these made me spent a whole lot of time before i could finally learn and 
finish up this project. 
I got the inspiration while i was watching Youtube from netninja. With the help of my mentor @CodeWithKyrian on twitter, i was able the learn more and also put 
in more work in it and others to come. I would really love to know what you all do think about this project. Thanks a lot as you check it out.
